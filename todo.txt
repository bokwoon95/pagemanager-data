recursively walk pm-assets, whenever you find a templates.toml mark the current dir as a template_namespace.

/pm-edit prefix will enable edit mode for the URL.
- If /pm-edit/ prefix, strip the prefix from the URL and inject pm-edit into the request context
- if pm-edit in the request context, inject pagemanager.js and pagemanager.css when serving templates
    - an added bonus is that even if the request is not routed to a template, the pm-edit context is propagated downstream to any potential handlers which can then customise their own pm-edit UI for the user.

/pm-json prefix will enable json mode
- If /pm-json/ prefix, strip the prefix from the URL and inject pm-json into the request context
- if pm-json in the request context, serve the data instead of the template
    - an added bonus is that even if the request is not routed to a template, the pm-json context is propagated downstream to any potential handlers which can then render their own JSON payloads instead of a HTML response.

remove fallback-assets.toml, replace with with getOK template function
- template authors can check if an image resource exists with getOK and tweak their <img> src accordingly.
- No need to construct a fallback image repository anymore.
